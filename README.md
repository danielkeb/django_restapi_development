# Django API Development Project
## Overview
### Welcome to the Django API Development Project! This project focuses on building a robust API with CRUD operations using the Django framework. The goal is to create an efficient and scalable API that interacts seamlessly with your database.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage your data effectively.
- Django ORM: Leverage Django's powerful Object-Relational Mapping to interact with the database effortlessly.
- RESTful Endpoints: Design RESTful API endpoints for intuitive and standardized communication with your application.
- Authentication and Authorization: Ensure secure access with Django's built-in authentication and authorization features.
- Documentation: Create clear and concise API documentation using tools like Swagger or DRF.
## Project Structure
- /api: Core directory for API development.
- /models: Define Django models for your data.
- /views: Implement views to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- /serializers: Serialize data for smooth communication between the API and client.
## Getting Started
- Install Django: pip install django
- Create a new Django project: django-admin startproject myproject
- Create a new app within your project: python manage.py startapp myapp
## Define models in models.py and migrate the database:
- python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate
- Implement views in views.py for CRUD operations.
 - Create serializers in serializers.py to convert complex data types into native Python data types.
## Usage
#### Run the development server: python manage.py runserver
- Access the API endpoints at http://localhost:8000/drinks/.
## Documentation
Explore the API documentation to understand available endpoints, request methods, and data formats. Use tools like Swagger or DRF to maintain comprehensive and user-friendly documentation.
